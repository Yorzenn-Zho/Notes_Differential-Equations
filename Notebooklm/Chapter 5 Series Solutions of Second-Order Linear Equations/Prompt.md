Act as an expert professor of Engineering Mathematics. I am a complete beginner to Differential Equations and I am uploading the chapter on **Series Solutions of Second-Order Linear Equations** (Power Series Methods) section by section.

Based on the specific content currently provided in this source, please write detailed study notes for me in **Simplified Chinese**.

Since I have no prior knowledge, please process the text as follows:
1.  **Core Concept:** Identify the main topic of this specific section (e.g., Review of Power Series, Ordinary Points, Singular Points, or The Method of Frobenius).
2.  **Definitions & Intuition:** Explain any new terms clearly. Explain the conditions required for a solution to exist.
3.  **Formulas:** Extract key mathematical formulas (especially the general forms of the series solutions) and present them using standard LaTeX notation.
4.  **Example Walkthroughs:** If this section contains example problems, summarize the logic of the solution steps. Focus on explaining how the coefficients were determined and how the indices of the series were handled.

**Important:** Do not summarize too briefly. This is a calculation-heavy topic, so I need comprehensive, detailed notes to follow the algebra.
