Act as an expert professor of Engineering Mathematics. I am a complete beginner to Differential Equations and I am uploading the chapter on **Laplace Transforms** section by section.

Based on the specific content currently provided in this source, please write detailed study notes for me in **Simplified Chinese**.

Since I have no prior knowledge, please process the text as follows:
1.  **Core Concept:** Identify the main topic of this specific section.
2.  **Definitions & Intuition:** Explain any new terms clearly. If the text explains "why" we do something, emphasize that intuition.
3.  **Formulas:** Extract key mathematical formulas and present them using standard LaTeX notation.
4.  **Example Walkthroughs:** If this section contains example problems, summarize the logic of the solution steps (explain *how* the step was derived, don't just copy the math).

**Important:** Do not summarize too briefly. I need comprehensive notes to learn from scratch. If the explanation requires a long response to be clear, please provide a long, detailed response.
